üåÅ Image Classification with PyTorch

This project is a deep learning model built with PyTorch to classify images of animal faces into three categories: cat, dog, and wild. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn features from the images and make predictions.

üöÄ Project Overview

This repository walks you through the complete process of building an image classification model. The key steps covered are:

1. Dataset Handling: Downloading the "Animal Faces" dataset from Kaggle.
2. Data Preprocessing: Loading image paths, splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets, and applying transformations.
3. Custom Dataset: Creating a custom PyTorch Dataset class for efficient data loading.
4. Model Building: Defining a custom CNN architecture from scratch.
5. Training & Validation: Training the model on the training set and evaluating its performance on the validation set.
6. Testing: Evaluating the final model on the unseen test set.
7. Inference: Using the trained model to predict the class of a new image.
